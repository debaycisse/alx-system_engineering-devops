You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

For every additional element, why you are adding it:
    The web infrastructure whose whiteboard representation link is provided above, contains:
    The firewall that protects it (infrastructure) from an unauthorized access or traffic from the external source (i.e. internet).
    The monitoring client or data collector collects live data regarding the health status of the server. It is used to collect
    any intended set of data to measure the health or perfomance of a typical server.

What are firewalls used for:
    The firewalls are used for the purpose protecting an internal network or infrastructure from malicious incoming traffic from
    the internet or external sources. It defines which traffic is allowed and which should be blocked via the firewall rule.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
    The traffic, which is coming from the user is served over HTTPS in order to encrypt or secure communication between the user
    and the server, thereby protecting a user's data, such as password, credit card as a set of data, exchanged during a
    communication travels through the internet.

What monitoring is used for:
    The Monitoring client is installed on each of the servers to collect their health data. A monitoring agent is used to collect
    health and perfomance data of a typical host system where it is installed and sends the data to a specified platform where it
    is analyzed and configured to alert a typical developer to take action in order to correct an issue that may negatively impact
    the users' experience.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data:
    The monitoring tool has a client software that is installed on the 3 servers, each installed instance of the data collector takes
    data from its host and sends it to a configured platform where the data is analyzed to get meaningful interpretations regarding
    the perfomance of the servers and the platform can also interprete the performance of the servers.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
    To monitor a web server QPS:
    A set of data, such as number of requests per seconds, number of response per seconds, and so on may be collected via the
    data collector agent and sent to be analyzed through the platform where the data collector is configured to forward the data in
    order to measure the number of queries or requests that a server can process per second. The analysis may be used to know the
    performance of the server in respect to the users' experience.

The Issues with this infrastructure:

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue:
    Terminating SSL at the load balancer may expose unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and the web servers.
    Ensuring end-to-end encryption across the entire communication path is essential for maintaining data integrity and security.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
    Relying on a single MySQL server for write operations poses a potential single point of failure. Implementing a primary replica
    cluster for MySQL is advisable to ensure data availability and introduce redundancy in the event of a server failure.

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem:
    Deploying servers with identical components for web, application, and database servers may lead to uneven resource consumption.
    It is crucial to customize resource allocation based on the specific requirements of each component to optimize overall performance.

    Secondly, bundling various components on a server will render every other components on the server down whenever any component
    is being maintained, even if the maintenance does have nothing to do with the other components.
