You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

In the infrastructure whose image representation is provided above:

There are 3 servers with differently roles, namely, web server, application server and database server respectively.

      - The Web Server handles users' requests for HTML static content, such as html document, image files,
      audio files and so on.
      This server hosts the html documents and other files that are hyperlinked in the html document as well.

      - The Application Server handles the business logic operations, such as retrieving of data, adding
      new data, modifying existing data and deleting existing data.
      It typically hosts the application file or code base, which contains the definition of the
      business logic operations.

      - The Database Server stores the data that has been collected so far in a structure that promotes
      efficient retrieval of data, creation of new data, deletion of the existing data, and
      modification of the existing data. It saves and persists every form of changes that are made to the data.

      - The Application server frequently communicates with this server (that is Database Server) to perform
      most of its operation.

      - The load balancer cluster enables two or more load balancers to be put into the use of evenly distributing
      incoming traffic to the existing servers.
      Having a cluster of load balancer eradicates the Single Point Of Failure (SPOF) for the infrastructure,
      regarding the load balancer.

      - Having all the components in cluster brings about High-availability and eradication of single point of failure.
